Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the course project for Coursera Course - Getting and Cleaning Data.

File "CodeBook.md" contains the details of transformation that is done to cleanup the data.

Script "run_analysis.R" is the actual script that performs data cleanup. 

Analysis is performed on data from source : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The data is downloaded and is unzipped, and the script "run_analysis.R" is placed in this extracted directory.

Post execution the script creates a file 'tidyData.txt' which has the tidy data.
